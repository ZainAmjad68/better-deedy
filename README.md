Better Deedy
=========================

An elegant XeTeX resume template with a distinct twist—featuring a one-page layout and two asymmetric columns. The design draws inspiration from the renowned [Deedy CV](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/deedy-cv/bjryvfsjdyxz) format and the sophisticated aesthetic of the [Novaresume Professional Resume](https://novoresume.com/editor/new-resume/6).

Catering to early and mid-level professionals with a substantial portfolio of projects and certifications, this resume is tailor-made for those who possess a rich repertoire of accomplishments and require a layout that can showcase their experience without things looking congested. 

Licensed under the Apache License 2.0, this template offers a modern solution for crafting impactful resumes.

## Motivation

The inspiration behind this LaTeX resume template comes from the highly effective Deedy CV format, renowned for its efficient use of space, visual appeal through organized formatting, and compatibility with [ATS](http://www.businessinsider.com/most-big-companies-have-a-tracking-system-that-scans-your-resume-for-keywords-2012-1) (Applicant Tracking System) used by many companies. While Deedy CV excels in most aspects, it has its shortcomings too. For example, the European and Asian regions usually expect the inclusion of a Profile Image and Personal Overview in the resume, and Deedy CV has no such options. Moreover, any existing options on the internet that fulfil these conditions are limited and most of them don’t offer any customization outside of their 'PRO' plans. To address this gap, I embarked on creating a contemporary, compact, and highly customizable template that meets diverse needs.

The outcome is this LaTeX Template, designed to maintain a **clean appearance**, **emphasize important details**, **fit within a single page**, and offer **extensive LaTeX templating** capabilities.
